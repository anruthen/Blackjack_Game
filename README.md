# Day 11 - Blackjack üÉè

This project is a console Blackjack game that lets the user play against the computer (dealer). The goal is to reach 21 points without going over. The game follows standard Blackjack rules.

## Features

- Fully interactive terminal Blackjack game
- Dealer draws automatically until reaching at least 17
- Aces count as 1 or 11 depending on score
- Blackjack detection
- Score comparison and result announcement
- Clear user output with score updates and final hands
- Option to play again

## How It Works

- Each player gets two cards from a virtual deck.
- The user decides to draw more cards or hold.
- The dealer draws until reaching a score of 17 or higher.
- If either has 21 from two cards, it's a Blackjack.
- Final scores are compared and the result is printed.
